# Milestone Project 1 
## Create a Band's Webpage

[Marie's Deployed Band Website Project](https://marie-o.github.io/first-milestone-project/index.html)

Hi! This project is about making a band's static and front-end only webpage that will include the band's images, songs and videos.
The page also serves as a means to contact the band for bookings and  to increase their social media fan base.

This is for educational purposes only and not intended for commercial use. 
Credits goes to the band - Tool and the artists - Cam de Leon and Alex Grey.

## Features

* First page has recent news about the band. At the bottom, there are big images to click to redirect to other pages. Great for users that want a quick navigation to see related content they're after. That feature is especially useful for users that are viewing content on mobile and might have sticky or wet fingers. Big icons are easier to click in cases like that.
* Second page has images for the band's concert and a list of tour venues and dates so the user can see when to go for live performances. The page also provides information where to book tickets.
* Third page has the list of all the band's albums and the songs. It also has demo songs that users can listen to. There's also info about future content that will be added there.
* Fourth page has media files. It has band images and videos that users can listen to without being redirected to a different page.
* Fifth page has the all the information about the band's members, history and the artist's that made the artworks.
* Sixth page is for contacting the band. The user has a contact form to use on this page where they only have to leave their name, email address and their message. They will also need to click the submit button to send their message to the band.
* Thank you page will show when a user submits a message so they can have a confirmation that their message has been sent.
* Each page on the website has footer that contains links to social media pages that the user can click if they would like to follow the band on social media platforms.

## Features Left to Implement

* Additional page dedicated for selling merchandise might be implemented in the near future.
* One colleague recommended a link to Google maps for tour venues. I like that idea.
* He also mentioned automatically adding tour dates to calendar. That is also a good feature to add in the future. (Thanks, Sipo!)

## Technologies Used

The technologies I used are:
* HTML5 is the markup language used for rendering the website.
[HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)

* CSS3 is the style sheet language used to style the HTML website.
[CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3)

* Bootstrap 4 Framework for the mobile responsiveness and grid layout of the website. 
I also used Bootstrap's core CSS for most of the styling and layout, buttons and forms; its core JavaScript for the carousel (image gallery slider) and the hamburger button.
[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## Testing

1. Used [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check the markup on each page. "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."

2. Used [CSS3 Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check CSS3 for any errors. "Congratulations! No Error Found. This document validates as CSS level 3 + SVG !"

3. I ran my page on [wed.dev](https://web.dev/) and this is the [report](https://lighthouse-dot-webdotdevsite.appspot.com/lh/html?url=https://marie-o.github.io/first-milestone-project/).

4. Contact form works as intended. 
   1. Go to 'Contact Us' page.
   2. If user does not type a name, user will get a reminder, "Please fill out this field".
   3. Email needs to include @ sign and a domain. If user clicks submit without an @ sign, user will get a message, "Please include an '@' in the email address. 'user's input' is missing an '@'.
   4. User also needs to enter a domain name for email address. If user forgets to type domain name after '@' sign, there will be a reminder saying, "Please enter a part following '@'. 'userinput@ is incomplete"
   5. If user does not type anything at the text area field, user will also be prompted to type something. User will get a reminder, "Please fill out this field".
   6. Once message is sent, there will be confirmation that message was sent. "Thank you for your message!"

5. The website is responsive on majority of mobile devices. 

6. There is a parallax effect on desktop that is disabled for mobile devices but the problem now is there appears to be two background images overlapping when you scroll up the page. I still haven't figured out how to fix it.
   According to [this w3s article](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_parallax.asp) the media query should disable the effect but the issue still persist.

## Acknowledgement

The genre of music I listen to are metal, rock and classical music. 
I chose this band because I figured most people would find the songs from this band to be more agreeable than the others I like.
I hope I did them justice and my website concept fits their music and ideals.

Thank you to everyone that gave me feedback to make this website better - my mentor, Chris Z, Rachel, Simen, Shane, Jeroen, and Sipo all gave me constructive criticism that made my project better.

My eternal gratitude to my supportive hubby that picked up my slack while I dedicated myself to this project. :heart_eyes:

And my little missy that has been my inspiration to give my 100% in everything I do.
